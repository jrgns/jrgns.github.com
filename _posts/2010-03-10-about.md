<div style="float: left; padding: 5px;">![alt text][1]</div> I'm a web developer with a passion for coding backends and API's. This site, and some of my other [projects][2], all run on [Backend][3], a open source PHP framework I scripted.

I'm currently head of development at [Branded Internet][4], a white label ISP provider. Check it out.

I live in South Africa, am married to Chantelle - my amazing wife - and I'm loving it!
