It can become quite difficult to keep PHP code structured and clean. There's a couple of good tools out there ([PHP Code Sniffer][1], [PHP Mess Detector][2], etc) to help you manage it, but it adds a lot of overhead that can bring your productivity down. One way to keep the advantage of checking your code without taking a productivity hit, is using a build system like Jenkins.<!--break-->

Look at [this blog post][3] to setup Jenkins and the various tools. There's also a [Jenkins PHP Template][4] that will help a great deal in getting things started.

I'm planning to play around with it, and post updates here about how it goes.
