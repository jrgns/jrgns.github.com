I really like working with PHP. It's a great language despite, a number of shortcomings, and I get to make a living out of writing PHP code. I also love to socialize, and the past few weeks I've been looking for a way to combine these two. 

I've looked for conferences or get togethers that I can attend. I looked for online groups or chatrooms about PHP where South Africans gathered. But I couldn't find any. Well, any active, constructive ones in any case.<!--break-->

I see that there's an active [Drupal][1] community in and around Jo'burg, so I'll try to attend some of their meetups.
